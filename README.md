# Prisoners-Puzzle
In this puzzle there are 100 prisoners, each given a distinct number 1-100. The jailer has decided to give all the prisoners a chance to escape. He prepares a challenge, and if every single one of the prisoners passes, they are all free to go. If even one of them fails, they all die.

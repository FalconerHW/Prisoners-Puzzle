# Prisoners-Puzzle
In this puzzle there are 100 prisoners, each given a distinct number 1-100. The jailer has decided to give all the prisoners a chance to escape. He prepares a challenge, and if every single one of the prisoners passes, they are all free to go. If even one of them fails, they all die.

In my version, you get to choose the number of prisoners, as well as a number of trials to test the success rate of your chosen method
